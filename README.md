## What I find interesting about applying Agile to Data Science
As a student with intern experience on a large data science team, I have personal experience with the increased uncertainity surrounding the scope of data science projects. While we've learned about the cone of uncertainty as applied to software engineering, the search space for solutions to data science needs is much larger, and simple insights can require massive overhauls to project requirements midway through a sprint. 

In my previous internship, this came up often in conversations with program managers, many of whom are still exploring new ways of dividing data science projects into smaller chunks. Many teams currently use a modified form of agile as designed for software engineering, but data science PMs are constantly searching for a better identity in the data science pipeline.
