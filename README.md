## What I find interesting about applying Agile to Data Science
As a student with intern experience on a large data science team, I have personal experience with the increased uncertainity surrounding the scope of data science projects. While we've learned about the cone of uncertainty as applied to software engineering, the search space for solutions to data science needs is much larger, and simple insights can require massive overhauls to project requirements midway through a sprint. 

In my previous internship, this came up often in conversations with program managers, many of whom are still exploring new ways of dividing data science projects into smaller chunks. Many teams currently use a modified form of agile as designed for software engineering, but data science PMs are constantly searching for a better identity in the data science pipeline.

## Comments by Larry Langman
I definatly agree with your perspective as well as that of the article. The application of Agile to Data Science would certainly decrease uncertainty in the entire process of data science. It is certainly a difficult task to break up Data Science projects into the equivalent of sprints, after all, each project is different. I wonder if a standardized application of Agile to Data Science will ever be created. While each firm may have its own methods, it would be interesting if there could be one agreed upon and standardized Agile for Data Science would surface that would then be taught at institutions such as NYU.
